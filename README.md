This was an initial effort to implement Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm in C++ as a thesis work of my students. Yet they did not finish the project, and all we have is cards isomorphism and bucketing algorithm. Implementation of CFR itself is untested, and will most probably fail to work.
